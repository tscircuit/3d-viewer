Let me break down how the CadViewer works in simple terms:
CadViewer.tsx is like the main coordinator:
It takes your circuit data (called "soup")
Creates the board geometry (the green PCB base)
Manages the list of components that need to be placed on the board
Handles hovering effects when you mouse over components
CadViewerContainer.tsx is like setting up the stage:
Creates a 3D canvas to draw everything on
Sets up the lighting (like studio lights in photography)
Adds the grid on the bottom (like a graph paper)
Handles the camera controls (so you can rotate and zoom)
Shows the small orientation cube in the corner
3. The different Models are like different actors on the stage:
STLModel:
}
Handles the PCB board itself - loads and displays the green base board
FootprinterModel:
}
Creates standard electronic components (like resistors, capacitors) based on their footprint size (like "0402" which means 0.4mm × 0.2mm)
JscadModel:
}
Handles custom 3D shapes defined in JSCAD (like a programming language for 3D shapes)
MixedStlModel:
}
Loads pre-made 3D models (like loading a 3D file someone created in a modeling program)
AnyCadComponent.tsx is like a smart router:
It looks at each component
Decides which type of Model to use based on what information is available
If it has a footprint → use FootprinterModel
If it has a 3D file URL → use MixedStlModel
If it has JSCAD code → use JscadModel
So in real-world terms, it's like:
Setting up a photography studio (CadViewerContainer)
Placing the main green board (STLModel)
Adding components one by one (AnyCadComponent)
Each component is either:
A standard part from a catalog (FootprinterModel)
A custom-designed part (JscadModel)
A pre-made 3D model (MixedStlModel)
When we want to create an SVG, we need to do all this but instead of showing it on screen, we take a "photo" from the top view and save it as an SVG file.
